# Microsoft-Malware-Detection
 the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest heavily in technologies to evade traditional protection, forcing the anti-malware groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks. The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to identify whether a given piece of file/software is a malware.
 Real-world/Business objectives and constraints:
Minimize multi-class error.
Multi-class probability estimates.
Malware detection should not take hours and block the user's computer. It should fininsh in a few seconds or a minute.
